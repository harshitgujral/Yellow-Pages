# Yellow-Pages
It is a Project on Data Structures using C++ graphics. This project is primarily based on Binary Search Tree and C++ Graphics. On the basic of user's data, we have implemented insertion, deletion and searching operation with interactive graphics. Moreover we have provided a comparison in time of execution of insertion and traversal in binary tree (using queue), BST, AVL Tree and Heap Tree.

C++ Graphics are not very presentable. This project is an attempt to learn Data-Structures with illustrations.
